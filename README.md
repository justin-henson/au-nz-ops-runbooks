# NZ Ops Runbooks — Incident Response, On-Call, and Postmortems

Practical runbooks and templates showing how I operate systems: triage, mitigation, communication, and learning loops.

## What this demonstrates
- Incident response workflow (SEV classification, comms, ownership)
- Standard runbook format for repeatable operations
- Postmortem templates focused on systemic fixes
- DR/BCP thinking (RTO/RPO, fallback modes)

## Start here
- `runbooks/index.md` (table of contents)
- `templates/incident-template.md`
- `templates/postmortem-template.md`

## Example runbooks
- ALB/Target health failing
- SSM session failures / endpoint issues
- “No NAT” private subnet troubleshooting
- IAM permission denied triage

## Next improvements
- Add diagrams per runbook + “first 5 commands” checklist
- Add alert thresholds and CloudWatch examples
